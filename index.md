Hello, I'm Sairam. As a Senior Staff Data Scientist at [Anumana](https://anumana.ai/), I architect machine learning solutions in Cardiac care. Beyond algorithms, I'm fascinated by movies, history, culture and the ever-evolving world of computer science and deep learning, **one eclectic thought at a time**.
