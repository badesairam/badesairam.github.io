## Bombay: A wedding present to the English
### Bumbye

Bombay or Mumbai , largest city in India, home to 20 million is a name that needs no introduction , but its origins are as charming as the city itself. Bombay came into the hands of the the honourable East India Company as a wedding present. Yes you read that right , Bombay or  the island of bumbye is part of Catherine of Braganza's dowry. She married Charles II  in 1661, considered one of the most popular English kings. She is the daughter of King John VI of Portugal. Bombay started out as a portuguese settlement at Bon Bahia ( the good bay). 

At this point , the British crown is not in India, even ironically no one at court seemed sure where this Bumbye was, as the map which accompanied the marriage contract went missing en route, though the Lord High Chancellor believed it to be 'somewhere near Brazil'. Charles II was heartily glad to be rid of the place. It had brought him only an expense which he could not afford and an obligation which he could not discharge. 

It took some more time to sort this issue and even longer to gain control of the island as the Portuguese governor had received no instructions to hand it over. On 19 March, 1662 Abraham Shipman was appointed the first Governor and General of the city of Bombay, and his fleet arrived there in about September 1662, his mission was blocked at gunpoint. It was a full three years before the British could take over, by which time the unfortunate Shipman, and all his officers bar his secretary, had died of fever and heatstroke sheltered on the then barren island of Anjediva island, Goa. Of the 500 members who arrived in 1662 only 191 members left the island in 1665 to claim the island of Bombay.

Despite this rocky start, the island soon proved it's worth: the Bombay Archipelago turned out to have the best natural harbour in South Asia, and it quickly became the company's major naval in Asia. Within thirty years Bombay had grown to house a colonial population of 60,000. By the 1680s Bombay had briefly eclipsed Madras, first English colonial town in India as the seat of power and trade of the English in the East Indies.
